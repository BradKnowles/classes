# Security

Take a look at the ASP.NET Core [cookie sample](https://github.com/aspnet/Security/blob/master/samples/CookieSample/Startup.cs). See if you can add a Razor page to your application that allows a user to sign-in by visiting the proper URL (no password valiation required). Display the user's identity on the page, and also allow a sign-out that is protected by the [Authorize] attribute.
