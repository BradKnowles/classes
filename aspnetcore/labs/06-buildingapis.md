# Adding the Movie API

To meet the goals of this lab, you'll need a movie API that allows you to:

- Add a movie
- Update a movie
- Delete a movie

You'll need to update your `InMemoryMovieData` to save movie data.

Make sure to enforce  a validation rule that each movie has a title, and the title has a length less than 80 characters. You'll need to reference the package `System.ComponentModel.Annotations`.
